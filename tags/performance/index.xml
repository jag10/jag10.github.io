      <description>As you can see on the graphics, I had 5s load time for my home page, which is kind of basic. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad if you look at the packages my server runs: gitlab, Roundcube&amp;rsquo;s webmail, sentora (open source control panel) and piwik (stats management). Note: Those 11s peaks you see there were produced while I was doing load tests on my server. My environment&amp;rsquo;s specs are:
 1 GB RAM VPS CentOS Linux release 7.</description>
