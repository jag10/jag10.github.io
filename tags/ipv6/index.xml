      <description>Last week all facebook buttons on domains on ALL of our servers stopped working. I always got a 404 response when facebook crawler tried to visit our domains. This happened in our 2 dedicated servers from 1and1. At first, my mates were trying to figure out if it was a joomla issue, but they finally couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve it, so they asked me to investigate it. My first thought was: you got a 404?</description>
