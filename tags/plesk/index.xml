      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week all facebook buttons on domains on ALL of our servers stopped working. I always got a 404 response when facebook crawler tried to visit our domains. This happened in our 2 dedicated servers from 1and1. At first, my mates were trying to figure out if it was a joomla issue, but they finally couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve it, so they asked me to investigate it. My first thought was: you got a 404? let&amp;rsquo;s check logs for those domains and we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens for sure. I checked those files and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any 404 error, the visit wasn&amp;rsquo;t even logged. Shit happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
