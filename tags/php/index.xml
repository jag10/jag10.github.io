      <title>How to handle remote resources with curl</title>

      <description>The problem When you need to get remote files to handle its content (i.e. csv files) you may find out that accesing them isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as using fopen: &amp;lt;?php $handle = fopen($filename, &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) or die(&amp;#39;could not open .&amp;#39; $filename);  If this sentence works, we could then use the handle to parse the file with different php functions like fgetcsv(). Usually, a lot of functions use a Resource param to handle files, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to know how to get a handle from a file.</description>

      <description>The problem Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the platform docs on which we are working, it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete or we just don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking for it. In those situations, we usually need more than the typical object&amp;rsquo;s var_dump, which only shows us the object properties but not its methods, which usually gives us that function we are working on without having to dive into the object&amp;rsquo;s properties. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll see the function I use for this task.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you need to work with only FTP access, and it takes a lot of time to backup a website through FTP because usually there are a lot of files and listing them is a long process. I made these php scripts to avoid wasting time when I only have FTP access. For example, when a mate wants to work on a website but he/she want to backup it up first just in case they break something.</description>

      <description>In this first post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I configurated my VPS to run a basic LAMP server with multiple php versions, compiled by myself. You can get your own cheap VPS (~3â‚¬) and test a lot of things. Firstly, we&amp;rsquo;ll create our dir structure. I&amp;rsquo;ll use jag.co as a domain for this example, you can choose the dir structure you want, but I recommend following this one: / /var/www/vhosts/jag.co /var/www/vhosts/jag.</description>
